Hey Laisvidas, 

Look! I prefer to be completely honest with you and transparent as well. This is a complicated project for me and it's going to take me a lot of more time to complete since: 
1- I came in the middle of the project 
2- I have to figure out lines of code that are not mine 
3- There are no developers from RTC I could talk to (that would really help)

I logged in a total of 4 hours and I know it will take me much more time (probably days) to solve the problem. I dont want to waste your time or money, so i feel that the best course of action at this point is to hire someone else who has more RTC experience than me. I will simply just cancel the contract and you wont have to pay me anything.

Please dont misunderstand, I will be more than happy to assist you with other projects. But at this moment, I dont feel that this particular project is a good fit for my skills.

Thank you again for your trust,

Best,
Unes
